JFLASH a jquery plugin to generate flash messages via ajax

ok, its under development, i will improve it probably daily :-)

You just have to add the css to your project (together with jquery and the jflash.js), create a div with id = flash in your layout
and start to use it

so you have your layout.html.erb with something like

<div id="flash">
</div>


so in your javascript you just have to do

$('#flash').jflash({message:'Hello world!', flash:'notice'});
